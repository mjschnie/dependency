We have modified edu.rit.pj.cluster.JobBackend to use the SystemClassLoader, which is ffx.FFXClassLoader in our case:

From:
Class<?> mainclass = Class.forName(theJobBackend.getMainClassName(), true, theJobBackend.getClassLoader());

To:
Class<?> mainclass = Class.forName(theJobBackend.getMainClassName(), true, ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader());
